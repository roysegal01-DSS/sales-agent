## 💡 Usage Examples

### Customer Conversation Analysis
```python
conversation = '''
Hi, I'm looking at my phone bill and it seems really high. I'm currently paying $85 per month 
and I feel like I'm not getting good value. I use my phone a lot for work - lots of video calls 
and I'm always streaming music during my commute. I travel internationally about twice a year 
for business, so I need good roaming options. My current plan only has 15GB of data and I'm 
constantly hitting my limit.
'''

# Agent automatically extracts:
# - Cost sensitivity: HIGH
# - Data priority: CRITICAL  
# - Usage pattern: BUSINESS
# - Pain points: High costs, data limits
# - International needs: MEDIUM
```

### Plan Comparison Output
```json
{
  "suitability_score": 8.5,
  "monthly_savings": 25.00,
  "annual_savings": 300.00,
  "key_improvements": [
