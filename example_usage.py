    Hi, I'm looking at my phone bill and it seems really high. I'm currently paying $85 per month 
    and I feel like I'm not getting good value. I use my phone a lot for work - lots of video calls 
    and I'm always streaming music during my commute. I travel internationally about twice a year 
    for business and the roaming charges are killing me. My current plan only gives me 15GB of data 
    and I'm constantly hitting the limit. I need unlimited data or at least way more than I have now. 
    The coverage at my office downtown is also pretty spotty - calls drop frequently. I've been with 
    my current carrier for 3 years but I'm ready to switch if I can get better value and reliability.
    I'd prefer not to be locked into a long contract if possible.
